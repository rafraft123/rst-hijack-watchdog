RST-Hijack Watchdog
A defensive network monitoring tool that detects TCP RST injection attacks in real-time.
Overview
This project implements a passive packet capture system that identifies malicious TCP RST (reset) packets indicative of connection hijacking attempts. The system monitors network traffic, applies behavioral heuristics, and generates alerts when suspicious RST activity is detected.
